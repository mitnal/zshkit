Matt Foster's zshkit fork
-------------------------

An easily extensible collection of `stuff` for zsh.

## Prompt info

I'm currently playing with the prompt, using `vcs_info`. For this to work, you'll need a version zsh > 4.3.6 (IIRC).

## Current issues:

* I haven't found a way to easily show when the repo is dirty.
* On my mac, opening additional zsh terminals doesn't give me coloured prompts.
* I keep seeing bits and bobs alluding to a 'new prompt colour' syntax, but I can't find any docs.
